Web Application Profiling using Statistical Techniques
From Application Security perspective

Brief Overview:
Worked on Statistical Approach for Application Profiling.
A network graph for entire website is created and various centrality measures such as PageRank Centrality, In degree Centrality, Out degree
centrality etc and Word Analysis were taken into consideration and the vulnerability score was found out using regression analysis.
So , when a new Web Application is given for testing, our programme basically creates a network graph, calculates various centrality 
measures and finds out the vulnerability score based on Regression analysis.



ReportsandPpts: folder contains the dtailed report of the project and 
Data: The XML files used for creating the graph and the excel sheet after reading the xml files
Pythoncode : has python codes for web scraping and xml parsing, centrality calculations
Regression_Analyis: Algorithm used for scoring and accuracy of Algoritm jupyter notebook
